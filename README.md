This is the first project within my Network and Cybersecurity Bootcamp at Georgia Tech University. Within this repository I will showcase different shell scripts and ansible playbooks that I have learned. In this repository you will see Ansible playbooks to configure filebeat, metricbeat, and a docker container configuration. I have also shown several configuration shell scripts that automate archives, software backups, cleanup filtered caches, and software updates. Along with the scripts that are intended for configuration I have included two scripts that are created to run scans of the system in full and partially weekly. The diagrams illustrate the configuration of different VMs within the same resource group but with different virtual networks, and the role a load balancer which adds a layer of protection to the local workstation.
