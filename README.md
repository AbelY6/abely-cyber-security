This is the first project within my Network and Cybersecurity Bootcamp at Georgia Tech University. Within this repository I will showcase different shell script and ansible playbooks that I have learned. In this repository you will see Ansible playbooks to configure filebeat, metricbeat, and a docker container configuration. I have also shown several configuration shell scripts that automate archives, software backups, cleanup caches, and software updates.
